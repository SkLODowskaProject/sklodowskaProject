The repository contains the material for the final project of the "Knowledge Organization and Cultural Heritage" course of the master's degree in [Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge) of the University of Bologna.

The final product is a **[website](https://sklodowskaproject.github.io/)** reporting the steps of the workflow followed for:
- Studying the selected domain (the life of Marie Sklodowska Curie);
- Elaborating the models to describe the domain;
- Producing new semantic data through the use of ontologies and controlled vocabularies.
