                        <p class="skloText2">The life of Maria Salomea Skłodowska can be read as a succession of events that led her, apart from other aspects, to consider scientific research as a great tool against any kind of preconception at her time.</p>

                        <p class="skloCitintext2">“There are sadistic scientists who hurry to hunt down errors instead of establishing the truth.”</p>
                            
                        <p class="skloText2">In the late 1903, writing about “the phosphorescence of uranium, discovered by M. Becquerel”, Marie Curie catched a glimpse of what it would be considered the greatest scientific discovery of the whole century, leading her to win two Nobel Prizes and numerous recognitions, being the first woman in the history to receive such an attention by the scholars community as the mass culture, until nowadays.</p>
                        <p class="skloText2">The choice of Marie Curie Skłodowska  as the keystone figure of this L.O.D. Project is an opportunity to explore her yet-contemporary figure and legacy, together with the aim of approaching the “non-insiders”, i.e. the casual surfers of the web, towards LODLAM activity and research.</p>

                            We’re in the Russian controlled Warsaw of the late 19th century, and Marie is the youngest of five children. As soon as she can remember, her parents care significantly about her higher education.
                            Thus, after her mother’s premature death, Marie finds herself, as a woman, without options in Poland for higher education. Along with her sister Bronislawa, she goes to a clandestine university, and soon she moves to Paris to continue her education. </p>

                            <p class="skloText"><span class="subSectionG">[Network] </span>
                            France becomes fertile land for Curie: the first relationship we can annoverate among her network is that with Henri Bequerel. Adopting the study of the radioactive characteristic in uranium as her thesis topic, Curie talks about the so-called "Becquerel rays" to see if other elements also have this quality. 
                            That can be considered as a valid momentum in which Marie demonstrates that radioactivity is not a property of an interaction between elements but is an intrinsic atomic property. 
                            In the meantime, in 1984 on her path she meets a French mathematician, Pierre Curie: they marry on July 26, 1895, in a civil marriage.</p>

                            <p class="skloCitintext1"> "RA = 225,93. Weight of an atom of radium"</p>

                            <p class="skloText"><span class="subSectionG">[Career] </span>
                            Pierre is teaching at the University of Sorbonne in Paris, while joining Marie’s laboratory and building a solid team-work, during a very private-conducted life. They soon come to some interesting discovery, following Henri Becquerel studies on the capacity of uranium of emitting a mysterious X-ray-like radiation that can interact with photographic film.
                            Marie and Pierre discover Polonium and then Radium and announce these elements in 1898: Polonium, named for Marie's native Poland and Radium, the Latin word for ray. They also coined the term radioactivity along the way.
                            Firstly overlooked from the Noble Prize nomination, Marie Curie wins the Noble Prize in Physics in 1903, together with Pierre Curie and Henri Bequerel.
                            From now on, her legacy and recognition exponentially grow, being apart from all the first female Nobel Laureate.
                            Tragedy struck in 1906 when Pierre is crushed by a horse-drawn cart as he crosses a busy intersection. Marie takes over Pierre's teaching position at the Sorbonne, becoming the school's first female professor.</p>
                            <p class="skloText"><span class="subSectionG">[An icon]</span>
                            Being very fruitful, her work leads Marie to acquire another Nobel in 1911, this time in chemistry for her earlier discovery of radium and polonium together with the extraction and analysis of pure radium and its compounds. Marie Curie's revolutionary research on radioactivity creates the groundwork for her activism towards first aid during World War I and female education.
                            These benefits to humanity may have come at a high personal cost: Marie died in 1934 due to her radiation exposure, two years later the foundation of her hospital for cancer disease.
                            For good or ill, her discoveries in radiation launched a new era, unearthing some of science's greatest secrets.</p>

                        Together with its luminescence, radium soon became well known for its "miraculous cures", so much so that it was referred to as a real “Radium Quackery”.</p>

                        In this graph are presented the items we chose, some entities connected with them, as well as data and relationships gathered from the holding institutions.
                        After this step we moved to the design of an E-R model, that is a first abstraction of our domain.</p>

                        <p class="skloText">This first modeling step has been really useful in order to characterize our idea and to better define relevant connections. Moreover, it also helped us to concretize the mental process behind the selection of the items.</p>

                            Since the institution does not provide a standard for the items mentioned in the table, we decided to apply the CCO standard.

                            Since the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) does not provide the name of a clear set of standards used, we decided to describe our item with that one provided by Schema.org,since it agrees with our thinking of openness and interoperability associated with the web3. Schema.org “is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet”. <a class="intextLinkbl" href="https://schema.org/docs/about.html">(see here)</a></p>

                                The Online Public Access Catalogue of SBN (Servizio Bibliotecario Nazionale) allows you to make bibliographic research on the collective catalogue of the italian libraries.
                                As standard, they provide both UNIMARC and MARC21. That’s why we decided to opt for MARC21, which provides more completeness and up-to-date metadata description.</p>

                                The Science Museum group is an aggregator of over 380,000 objects and archives from realms in the UK.

                                For this reason, we decided to select a standard on our own, the IPTC, that could specify metadata properties with a focus on usage with photos (for reference, see the link <a class="intextLinkbl" href="https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata-2021.1.html)">here</a>).</p>

                                Since the items on BritishPaté are taken from a wider archive, i.e. the Reuters historical collection, we decided to choose the suitable <a class="intextLinkbl" href="https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/CBPS_2000_Guidelines_ISAD%28G%29_Second-edition_EN.pdf"> ISAD(G) standard</a> devoted to archival resources.

                                The choice about the most suitable and complete standard to describe our last two items, the article and the notebook,fell on MARC21 for its completeness and because it’s in charge of different types of metadata.</p>

                        <p class="skloText">At this stage of the project we have developed a theoretical model by analyzing more in depth our items and entities. We have gathered all the possible connections between them and we enhanced the description of our domain in natural language. As you can see, the scenario is extremely interconnected so we had to make some choices in order to represent it in the most accurate and clear way. Such choices led us to add new descriptions collected from the web and also to draw new relationships between items, their descriptions and the entities of our domain.

                        </p>

                        <p class="skloText">After having designed the theoretical model we moved back to the E/R model and we focused on the abstraction and categorisation of our domain, by highlighting all the new connections and deeply restructuring the graph.</p>

                        </p>   
                        <p class="skloText2">In order to do that we have chosen the most appropriate ontologies for each one of the categories extracted from the initial 4W model: Person and Institution, Place, Event, and Concept. We have produced 4 tables - one for each of the aforementioned categories - and a graphical visualization of the entire description in which we also created a more general legend in which we have summarized the description of the general entities.</p>
                        <p class="skloText2">In order to provide an accurate description of our entire domain we have decided to begin from the particular to move then into a more broader classification of entities and predicates. 
                        With this aim in mind we decided to use foaf in order to describe people and relations among them, geo for the description of our places, fabio for our textual items and their descriptions and finally xsd have been used to define literals. 
                        For what concerns the definition of our concepts we adopted a description that is at the same time general if seen from the viewpoint of the entire scenario, and specific if considered from the point of view of each one of them, in fact we decided to harmonize their description thanks to general-scope ontologies and vocabularies such as cidoc-crm, dbpedia-owl, dublin core, rdf, rdfs and schema, also useful as glue for the entirety of our elements and their connections.
                        Finally, we decided to use frapo and in particular modsci - that is an ontology specifically designed for scientific culture - to define and describe more characteristic entities and predicates of our domain.</p>
