                        <p class="skloText2">The life of Maria Salomea Skłodowska can be read as a sequence of events that led her, apart from other aspects, to consider scientific research as a great tool against any kind of preconception at her time.</p>

                        <p class="skloText2">In the late 1903, writing about “the phosphorescence of uranium, discovered by M. Becquerel”, Marie Curie catched a glimpse of what would be considered the greatest scientific discovery of the century, leading her to win two Nobel Prizes and numerous recognitions, being the first woman in history to receive such a consideration by the scholars' community.</p>
                        <p class="skloText2">Marie Curie has been chosen as the subject of this Linked Open Data Project for multiple reasons. Firstly, we thought that it would have been a great opportunity for rediscovering her yet-contemporary figure. Furthermore, the choice was also driven by the aim of facilitating the approach to the project by the “non-insiders”, i.e. the casual surfers of the Web, thanks to the well known story of such an important character.</p>

                        <p class="skloText"><span class="subSectionG">[Early years]</span>
                            Marie was born in Warsaw in 1867 as the youngest of five children. After her mother’s premature death, she found herself, as a woman, without options for an higher education in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, at that time part of the Russian Empire. For this reason she attended a clandestine university until she moved to Paris in 1891 along with her sister Bronislawa. Here she continued studying and she conducted her subsequent scientific works.</p>

                            <p class="skloText"><span class="subSectionG">[Network] </span>
                            The first relationship we can annoverate among the ones in her network is that with Henri Bequerel, the French physicist that discovered evidences of radioactivity. Choosing the study of the radioactive characteristic in uranium as her thesis topic, Curie started to investigate the emission of the so-called "Becquerel Rays". 
                            That can be considered a valid momentum in which Marie demonstrated that radioactivity is not a property of an interaction between elements but rather an intrinsic atomic property. 
                            It is in the same period, in 1894, that she met another French physicist: Pierre Curie, who would became her husband in 1895.</p>

                            <p class="skloCitintext1"> "RA = 225,93. Weight of an atom of radium"</p>

                            <p class="skloText"><span class="subSectionG">[Career] </span>
                            Pierre was teaching at the University of Sorbonne, in Paris, and building a solid team-work with Marie by joining her laboratory, while the two scientists came to some interesting discoveries. Following Becquerel's studies on uranium's capacity of emitting X-ray-like radiations that could interact with photographic films, Marie and Pierre discovered both Polonium and Radium. The new wlements were announced in 1898: Polonium was named after Marie's native land, and Radium after the Latin word for "ray". Along the way, they also coined the term "radioactivity".
                            Marie Skłodowska Curie won the Noble Prize in Physics in 1903, together with Pierre Curie and Henri Bequerel. From that moment onwards, her legacy and recognition grew exponentially.
                            After Pierre's death in 1906, Marie took over his teaching position at the Sorbonne, becoming the first female professor at the University of Paris.
                            Marie's fruitful work led her to won another Nobel in 1911, this time for chemistry. The reasons were her earlier discoveries of radium and polonium together with the extraction and analysis of the pure radium and its compounds.</p>

                            <p class="skloText"><span class="subSectionG">[The icon]</span>
                            Marie Curie's work has been crucial not only for her activism towards both first aid during the First World War and female education, but also for its contribution to the shape the world has today, both from the scientific and the societal points of view.
                            The benefits to humanity may have come at an high personal cost: Marie died in 1934 due to the long-term exposure to radiations. Two years before, she founded the Radium Insitute of Warsaw, the second research institute established by the scientist after the Curie Institute of Paris.</p>

                        <p class="skloText2">Firstly, we thought about what in our opinion could draw a <span class="italicText">file rouge</span> through Marie Curie’s life.

Curie. That is why the items presented in this project are actually 11, 2 of which are exactly of the same type.</p>
                        <p class="skloText2">In particular, the objects have been chosen also because they have special connections with other people, places, periods of time and concepts.

                        The negative effects of radioactivity were discovered only at a later time. Meanwhile, also the production of beauty treatments based on radioactive components increased exponentially.
                        Together with its luminescence, radium soon became well known for its "miraculous cures", until many products relying on the imaginary powers of this element became to be referred to as real “Radium Quackeries”, radithor included.</p>

                        After this step, we moved to the design of an E-R model, that is a first abstraction of our domain.</p>

                            Since the institution does not provide a standard for the items mentioned in the table, we decided to apply the CCO standard.

                            Since the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) does not provide the name of the set of used standards, we decided to describe our item with the one provided by Schema.org. This has been done since Schema.org provides an effective way to describe information related to movies, but also for the guarantee of interoperability coming from this “collaborative community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet”. <a class="intextLinkbl" href="https://schema.org/docs/about.html">(see here)</a></p>

                                The Online Public Access Catalogue of SBN (Servizio Bibliotecario Nazionale) allows one to make bibliographic research on the collective catalogue of the italian libraries.
                                For what concerns the standards, both UNIMARC and MARC21 are declared to be used. In particular, we decided to opt for MARC21, which provides the possibility of creating more complete and up-to-dated metadata descriptions.</p>

                                The Science Museum group is an aggregator of over 380,000 objects and archives in the UK.
                                The institution developed an <a class="intextLinkbl" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ail2.23">AI system to set up predicates</a>. 
                                For this reason, we decided to select a standard on our own, the IPTC, that could specify metadata properties with a focus on photographs (for reference, see the link <a class="intextLinkbl" href="https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata-2021.1.html)">here</a>).</p>
                            <p class="skloText2"><span class="subSectionP">[Video]</span>
                                Since the items on BritishPaté are gathered from a bigger archive, i.e. the Reuters historical collection, we decided to choose the suitable <a class="intextLinkbl" href="https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/CBPS_2000_Guidelines_ISAD%28G%29_Second-edition_EN.pdf"> ISAD(G) standard</a> devoted to archival resources.

                                The choice about the most suitable and complete standard to describe our last two items, the article and the notebook, fell once more on MARC21 thanks to its wide coverage.</p>

We gathered all the possible connections between the entities and we produced an enhanced description of the domain in natural language. As it can be seen, the scenario is extremely interconnected. This is due to the fact that we both collected new descriptions from the web and drew new relationships between the items and the other relevant entities of our domain.

                        <p class="skloText">After having designed the theoretical model, we moved back to the E/R model maintaining the focus on the abstraction and categorisation of our domain. Thus, all the new connections have been highlighted and the graph has been deeply restructured.</p>

                        <p class="skloText2">In order to do that we chose the most appropriate ontologies for each of the categories extracted from the initial 4W model: Person and Institution, Place, Event, and Concept. We produced 4 tables - one for each of the aforementioned categories - and a graph of the entire description. In the latter, we also created a more general legend in which the description of the entities is summarized.</p>
                        <p class="skloText2">In the interest of providing an accurate description of our domain, we decided to begin from the specific to move then to a broader classification of entities and predicates. 
                        Given this aim, we decided to use FOAF ontology in order to describe people and relations among them, Geo ontology for the description of our places and FaBiO ontology for our textual items and their descriptions.
                        For what concerns our concepts, we decided to harmonize their description thanks to general-scope ontologies and vocabularies such as CIDOC-CRM, DBpedia-OWL, Dublin Core, RDF, RDFS and Schema.org. This selection was driven also by the possibility of using some terms as a special glue to stick together some entities with their connections and descriptions.
                        Finally, we decided to use FRAPO and ModSci ontologies - the last of which is specifically designed for scientific culture - to define and describe the most peculiar entities of our domain, such as the chemical elements.</p>

The dedscriptions can be viewed both in the table below and in the linked csv files. As the final step of this project, we decided to represent one of the items and the entirety of its connections as RDF triples using a turtle-syntax-based serialization. Before doing that, we managed to populate our knowledge graph throughout the production of our own URIs.</p>
